# Leaf-Disease-detection

This project focuses on detecting diseases in plant leaves using two deep learning models:

CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for image classification and
YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once - Version 5) for object detection, with the dataset managed through Roboflow.


**Roboflow was used for:**

Data annotation and organization.
Dataset preprocessing (augmentation, resizing).
Exporting the dataset in YOLOv5 format.

**The objective of this project is to classify plant leaves into two categories:
**
Healthy and
Unhealthy
We achieve this using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is trained on images of leaves.
