# Leaf-Disease-detection

This project focuses on detecting diseases in plant leaves using two deep learning models:

CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for image classification.
YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once - Version 5) for object detection, with the dataset managed through Roboflow.


**Roboflow was used for:**

Data annotation and organization.
Dataset preprocessing (augmentation, resizing).
Exporting the dataset in YOLOv5 format.
